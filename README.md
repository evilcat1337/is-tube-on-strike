# Is Tube on Strike?

## Why?

To inform people when to avoid going to London. Also, the tube strike is a very annoying event.

## How it works?

If there's no strike, the site is saying NOPE.

If there's a strike going on, then the site will say YEP... and live of people having unpleasent pleasure to travel that day throught London is going to be miserable. Really, if the site says YEP... consider not using public transport in London, especially during rush hours.
